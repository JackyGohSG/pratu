Phileas Fogg, as self-composed as if the judgment did not in the least concern him, did not even lift his eyebrows while it was being pronounced.  Just as the clerk was calling the next case, he rose, and said, "I offer bail."
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
Fix saw them leave the carriage and push off in a boat for the steamer, and stamped his feet with disappointment. Eleven o'clock was striking; Mr. Fogg was an hour in advance of time.

"I will pay it at once," said Mr. Fogg, taking a roll of bank-bills from the carpet-bag, which Passepartout had by him, and placing them on the clerk's desk. "This sum will be restored to you upon your release from prison," said the judge.  "<strong>Meanwhile, you are liberated on bail</strong>." "Come!" said Phileas Fogg to his servant. "But let them at least give me <a href="#">back my shoes!</a>" cried Passepartout angrily. "Ah, these are pretty dear shoes!" he muttered, as they were handed to him.  "More than a thousand pounds apiece; besides, they pinch my feet."

Fix still nourished hopes that the robber would not, after all, leave the two thousand pounds behind him, but would decide to serve out his week in jail, and issued forth on Mr. Fogg's traces. That gentleman took a carriage, and the party were soon landed on one of the quays. The Rangoon was moored half a mile off in the harbour, its signal of departure hoisted at the mast-head.

The rascal is off, after all!" he exclaimed.  "Two thousand pounds sacrificed!  He's as prodigal as a thief!  I'll follow him to the end of the world if necessary; but, at the rate he is going on, the stolen money will soon be exhausted. The detective was not far wrong in making this conjecture.  Since leaving London, what with travelling expenses, bribes, the purchase of the elephant, bails, and fines, Mr. Fogg had already spent more than five thousand pounds on the way.

However, the trip from Calcutta to Hong Kong only comprised some three thousand five hundred miles, occupying from ten to twelve days, and the young woman was not difficult to please. During the first days of the journey Aouda became better acquainted with her protector, and constantly gave evidence of her deep gratitude for what he had done.

He visited her regularly each day at certain hours, not so much to talk himself, as to sit and hear her talk.  He treated her with the strictest politeness, but with the precision of an automaton, the movements of which had been arranged for this purpose.

She did, indeed, belong to the highest of the native races of India. Many of the Parsee merchants have made great fortunes there by dealing in cotton; and one of them, Sir Jametsee Jeejeebhoy, was made a baronet by the English government.  Aouda was a relative of this great man, and it was his cousin, Jeejeeh, whom she hoped to join at Hong Kong.
